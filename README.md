## Shape (shp) Extension for HHVM (HipHop virtual machine)

This is a port from PECL shape extensioni for [HipHop PHP VM][fb-hphp], with
some fixes and enhancements, which is a wrapper library to
[libshape][libshape].

"The Shapefile C Library provides the ability to write simple C programs for
reading, writing and updating (to a limited extent) ESRI Shapefiles"

### Prerequisites

This extension requires `libshp` library installed. On Gentoo it is included
in `sci-libs/shapelib` ebuild.

### Building & Installation

Installation requires HHVM version 3.10.0 or later. For older HHVM versions
check "hhvm-pre-3.10" branch.

~~~
$ cd /path/to/extension
$ ./build.sh
~~~

This will produce a `shp.so` file, the dynamically-loadable extension.

To enable the extension, you need to have the following section in your HHVM
config file (php.ini style config):

~~~
hhvm.dynamic_extension_path = /path/to/hhvm/extensions
hhvm.dynamic_extensions[dbase] = dbase.so
~~~

Where `/path/to/hhvm/extensions` is a folder containing all HipHop extensions,
and `shp.so` is in it. This will cause the extension to be loaded when the
virtual machine starts up.

### Differences from PECL

* Added function `shp_get_array_from_object` to convert SHP object properties
to PHP array.
* Function `shp_create_simple_object` will fail if not all arguments are
passed.

As always, bugs should be reported to the issue tracker and patches are very
welcome.
